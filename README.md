# üé¨ Getting Started

**Step 1: Retrieve your Cisco Meraki API Key**
   - Before you begin, make sure you have Cisco Meraki API key.
   - You can retrieve it from your Cisco Meraki Dashboard, for this you can refer to the [Cisco Meraki Dashboard API](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Other_Topics/Cisco_Meraki_Dashboard_API) Knowledge Base.

**Step 2: Store the key in the Encrypted AES-256 DB**
   - When you run the program for the first time it will ask you to create the DB.
   - Create the DB and then select option 5 from the Main Menu called **Set your Cisco Meraki API Key**
   - Paste your Cisco Meraki API key and press enter. The key will be stored securely and can be edited by selecting option 5 again. For security reasons there will be no option to show the Cisco Meraki API key after this have been saved.

**Step 3: Use the program**
   - Your key is stored and are ready to go.
