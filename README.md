# üé¨ Getting Started

**Step 1: Retrieve your Cisco Meraki API Key**
   - Before you begin, make sure you have your Cisco Meraki API key.
   - You can retrieve it from your Cisco Meraki Dashboard, for this you can refer to the [Cisco Meraki Dashboard API](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Other_Topics/Cisco_Meraki_Dashboard_API) Knowledge Base.

**Step 2: Store the key in the Cisco Meraki CLU Encrypted Database**
   - When you run the program for the first time it will ask you to create the Database and protect with a password. Use a strong password since you will need it each time you run the program.
   - Create the Database and then select the menu option called **Set your Cisco Meraki API Key**
   - Paste your Cisco Meraki API key and press enter. The key will be stored securely and can be edited again later. For security reasons there will be no option to show the Cisco Meraki API key after this have been saved.

**Step 3: Use the program**
   - Your key is stored and you are ready to go.
   - Browse the option to use the program.
